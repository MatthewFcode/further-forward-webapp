# Further Forward Web App

## Live at: https://further-forward-webapp-yep.onrender.com

## Overview
This is my personal portfolio website, built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, featuring interactive elements and smooth animations powered by **AOS (Animate On Scroll)**. I built this project **before starting the Dev Academy bootcamp** as a way to practice my web development skills and experiment with interactivity and animations.

The website offers a fully interactive experience, including a **mini-game** that allows users to engage directly with the site. It serves as both a showcase of my skills and a playful demonstration of my creativity.

## Features
- **Responsive Design:** Works across different screen sizes and devices.
- **Animations:** Utilizes **AOS** for smooth scroll-based animations.
- **Interactive Game:** Users can engage with a small in-browser game embedded in the site.
- **Portfolio Showcase:** Highlights projects and personal work.
- **Modern UI/UX:** Clean, user-friendly interface.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5** – Structure of the website
- **CSS3** – Styling and layout, including responsive design
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – Interactive features and game functionality
